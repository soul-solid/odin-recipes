        Pasta salad is a versatile dish made with cooked pasta and a variety of vegetables, cheeses, and proteins, all tossed in a dressing. The dressing can be mayonnaise-based, vinaigrette, or a combination of both. Common ingredients include tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, olives, and feta or mozzarella cheese. Pasta salad is often served cold, making it a popular choice for picnics, barbecues, and potlucks.
