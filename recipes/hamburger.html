        A hamburger is a popular sandwich consisting of a cooked patty of ground meat, typically beef, placed inside a sliced bun. Common toppings include lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. The patties can be grilled, fried, or barbecued, and there are many variations, including vegetarian options. Hamburgers are a staple of American cuisine and are enjoyed worldwide in fast food restaurants, diners, and barbecues.
