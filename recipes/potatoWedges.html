        Potato wedges are thick slices of potatoes, often seasoned with spices like paprika, garlic powder, and salt, and then baked or fried until crispy. They are a popular side dish or snack, known for their crunchy exterior and fluffy interior. Potato wedges are often served with dipping sauces such as ketchup, ranch, or sour cream.
