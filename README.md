This is my rendered "Project: Recipes" solution of The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum.

This will demonstrate some basic skills I picked up following TOP: basic HTML and some conventions initially, and later in the curriculum, styling with CSS, which I tailored into this project.

As the name implies, it is a recipe website that will introduce you to the processes of preparing some popular dishes. All the recipes have been gathered from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
